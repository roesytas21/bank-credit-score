# Bank Credit Score
I joined practicum bootcamp as Data Analysis and this is one of my project. This project aims to prepare a report for the bank's credit department. In this case, the data is needed to determine the effect of marital status and the number of children that belongs to the family on the possibility of paying the loan on time.

This report will affect the credit assessment for prospective of the bank to the customers as one of the factors to evaluate the ability of prospective them to repay their loans.

The data has 21,525 entries and 12 colums. The columns are:
1. `children` - the number of children in the family
